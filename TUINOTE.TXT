Short reference:

* Tab / Shift+Tab       - move between elements
* Esc                   - close dialog discarding changes
* Ctrl+F5, arrow keys   - move window
* Enter or Space        - press a button
* Space on [x] or (*)   - select
* highlighted symbols (shortcuts) are working unless other
  component has captured input. Edit lines usually do that.

Mouse allows to set focus, press buttons, select items.
Also can move windows using mouse by window header.

Lists:
* TList       - basic vertical list, standard dialog component
* TMenuList   - pop-up window with the list
* TColumnList - list with colums (as seen in FileOpen dialog)
* TCustomList - fully customizable list; developer controlled

For example, this parrticualr list is a TCustomList and it
allows to "tag" lines using Space key. Also, you can scroll
using left and right arrow keys.

TButton, TCheckBox and TRadioButton has built-in hotkeys.
For other components you can define hotkeys using THotKey
(invisible) component.

There are two evBroadcast-type events: cmUpdate and cmActivate.
They are handled by each TUI component. cmUpdate can be local
or global. Global cmUpdate calls Update() for all components and
is invoked this way:

PostMessage( evBroadcast, cmUpdate );

Local cmUpdate updates component specified in target parameter:

  // global var
  TEdit* myedit;
  // in some component's code:
  PostMessage( evBroadcast, cmUpdate, myedit );

cmActivate sets focus on specified component if it is marked as TabStop,
or the first component with TabStop.
